# Mediatec Manager 

This is an university project developed in a OOP course taken at Bordeaux-INP in 2023. 

## Directory  Structure

Basically, there are two directories, the **Project** directory  which contains the sources and the Makefile that compiles the project and the **DEMO**. Inside the latter, there is a pre-compiled executable of the application alongside with dummy data that can be used to test some of the app's funcionalities and a thorough presentation of the project with its corresponding UML files. I encourage you to check it out by yourself, just run main.exe and interact with the program!

This project uses most of the key concepts of OOP in C++ such as inheritance, virtual functions and many more.
